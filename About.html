            <h3>Virat Kohli</h3>
           <p>born 5 November 1988 is an Indian 
           international cricketer and the former captain of the 
           Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed 
           batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and 
           for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as 
           one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds 
           the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals 
           and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket 
           Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. 
           Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's 
           successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 
           2013 Champions trophy.</p>
            <p>Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained 
           at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth 
           career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his 
           international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key 
           player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 
           2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the 
           ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 
           2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs 
           scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet 
           another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test 
           batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold 
           the number one spot in all three formats of the game. 
           His form continued in 2019, when he became the first 
           player to score 20,000 international runs in a single 
           decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as 
           the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, 
           following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped 
           down as the captain of the Test team as well.</p>
            <p>He has received many accolades for his 
           performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as 
           the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the 
           Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer 
           of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 
           respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test 
           Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards 
           in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in 
           the same year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden 
           Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive 
           years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli 
           was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma 
           Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel 
           Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 
           2018.</p>
